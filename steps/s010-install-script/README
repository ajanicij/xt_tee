Wow! Please write an auto-install script.
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely â€” here's a clean, portable auto-install script that:

âœ… Compiles xt_tee
âœ… Installs it to /usr/local/bin
âœ… Installs the man page to /usr/local/share/man/man1
âœ… Updates the man database
âœ… Verifies the installation
ðŸ§¾ install_xt_tee.sh

Save this as install_xt_tee.sh and make it executable (chmod +x install_xt_tee.sh).

Usage

chmod +x install_xt_tee.sh
./install_xt_tee.sh

ðŸ§ª After Install, Try:

xt_tee --help
xt_tee --version
man xt_tee
