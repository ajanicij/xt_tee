This is actually already more than what I had in mind. One more thing would make it perfect for me: can you just please add a short manpage document?

Absolutely! Here’s a clean, short man page for your xt_tee tool — modeled after standard Unix man page conventions and customized with all the features you’ve added.

How to Install the Man Page

    Save it as xt_tee.1

    Move it to a man directory (e.g., /usr/local/share/man/man1/)

sudo cp xt_tee.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/
sudo mandb

    Use it:

man xt_tee
