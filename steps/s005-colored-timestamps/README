Would you like to:

    Log to stderr instead of stdout?

    Add colors for timestamps?

    Compress log output?

Let me know â€” I can help extend it further!

It is a great idea to add colors for timestamps! So please add another option to add color to stamps, but only for writing to standard output.

Awesome â€” colored timestamps are a great usability enhancement when viewing output in a terminal. Let's add that next!
âœ… New Feature

Add this option:

--color[=always|never|auto]

Purpose: Apply ANSI color to timestamps on stdout only.
ðŸŽ¯ Behavior Summary
Value	Meaning
always	Always colorize timestamps on stdout
never	Never colorize timestamps
auto	Color if stdout is a terminal (default)

Only affects stdout, never modifies timestamps in files.
